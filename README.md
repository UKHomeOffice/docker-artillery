Artillery (performance testing toolkit) CI container
====================================================

The goal for this project is to dockerise [artillery] and make it give exit codes which can then be used in a CI pipeline.

*Please note, this image is not yet ready for production.*

Getting started
---------------

Make sure you have [Docker] and [Docker Compose] installed on your system
and run:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:UKHomeOffice/docker-artillery-ci.git
$ cd docker-artillery-ci
$ docker-compose up
```

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is available using environment variables in order to configure the container.

```
MAX_LATENCY: <The maximum response latency threshold allowed before failing (in ms)>
MIN_RPS: <The minimum rps threshold allowed before failing>
TEST_CONFIG: <The artillery config. This will be used when running the performance tests.>
```
